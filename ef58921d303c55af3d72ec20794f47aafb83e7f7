Prompt: Develop a high-performance Point3D class in Python with: Unique ID (long long) and float coordinates (x, y, z). Optimized memory storage using efficient Python types.
 C extension (Cython or ctypes) for performance improvements.
Create a PointCloud class as a collection of Point3D instances,
implementing: Geometric operations: Distance computation between two points using their IDs. Slope calculation in percentage. Bearing angle computation.
 KD-tree spatial indexing for fast nearest-neighbor searches.
Code adherence to PEP8 and detailed docstrings.
Performance benchmarks for 100,000 Point3D instances.
 Unit tests ensuring at least 80% test coverage.
